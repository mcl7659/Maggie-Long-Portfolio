  <div class="project">
    <h3>ðŸŽ“ Grad Job Search Engine</h3>
    <video controls class="project-video">
      <source src="assets/videos/JobSearchDEMO.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
    <p>This project is my most ambitious and meaningful solo project to date. It began as a passion project sparked by my frustration â€” and that of many peers â€” with the post-grad job hunt. "Entry-level" jobs asking for 3+ years of experience just didnâ€™t make sense.</p>

    <p>I created this prototype entirely on my own, handling both the front and back end. I designed the user interface using Figma and built the functionality with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used Python for the backend logic and even experimented with a fine-tuned BERT model to better understand job descriptions.</p>

    <p>To train the model, I used anonymized job data from my campus career center to identify realistic requirements versus inflated ones â€” making this more than just a keyword search engine.</p>

    <p>Through surveys and interviews, I learned how grads approach the job search and designed a responsive layout that worked well on both desktop and mobile. Accessibility and inclusive design were central to my process from start to finish.</p>

    <p>Itâ€™s still a prototype, and I may or may not finish it â€” but I genuinely hope to one day make tools like this a reality. Whether through this project or others like it, I want to help bridge the gap for students navigating a tough job market.</p>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>ðŸŒ¼ Spring Packs for New Normal Life</h3>
    <p>Designed for college students, these Spring Packs were created through freelance work for New Normal Life, with CVS as a sponsor. I worked closely with the team to bring their ideas to life visuallyâ€”translating their goals into designs that would best resonate with our intended audience. Although my main role was focused on design, I also contributed feedback on how to structure the packs in a way that would connect with students and represent the brand effectively.</p>

      <h3>ðŸ§˜ Procreate Illustration</h3>
      <p>This piece was drawn in Procreate during my free time as a way to relax and destress creatively. I enjoy using digital tools like this for fun expression.</p>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>ðŸ“œ Boston Tea Party Design</h3>
    <p>This project challenged me to represent a historical event without directly naming it. I chose the Boston Tea Party and created a design that subtly communicates its essence through symbolic imagery. The final piece was meant to be visually engaging while prompting the viewer to guess the event â€” an exercise in conceptual design and visual storytelling.</p>
